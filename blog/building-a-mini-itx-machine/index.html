<p>It's been a while since the last time I built a computer from scratch. I think
it was in 2005. I say that because I remember a buddy of mine wanted me to play
World of Warcraft with him and I needed a new rig to do that. Since then I've
gradually upgraded some components (RAM, GPU, HDDs), but other than that It's
the same build as it was 10+ years ago.</p>
<p>Time for a refresh. Here's a list of components that I bought for my new rig:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming5 Motherboard</li>
<li>Intel i5-6500 LGA 1151 3.2 GHz Skylake CPU</li>
<li>Fractal Design Node 304 Case</li>
<li>Seasonic G-Series 550 W PSU</li>
<li>2x Corsair Vengeance LPX 8 GB 2666 MHz DDR4</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some parts that I scavenged from my old build to cut down on cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSi N630GT-MD1GD3 (NVIDIA GeForce GT630) GPU</li>
<li>256 GB Samsung 840 EVO SSD</li>
<li>2x 2 TB WD 7200 RPM HDDs</li>
</ul>
<p>The SSD is used for my OS and SWAP partitions, while the two HDDs are set up as
a mirrored ZFS pool and mounted as my <code>/home</code> directory.</p>
<p>I chose to go with a mini-ITX build because I had never built one before, but I
use to live with housemates who had these awesome shoebox sized rigs that fit
on their desktop. They were actually mini-DTX builds, but close enough. Also, I
thought it was finally time to get rid of my optical drive, and I really wanted
to have USB3 ports as well.</p>
<p>It being so long since I had built a computer from scratch, I did run into some
issues. The first thing I did was mount my CPU on the motherboard and pop on
the stock CPU fan that came with the processor. I then put the stand-offs into
my new case and installed the motherboard. Next I installed my GPU, SSD, and
RAM. I only added the OS drive to check to see that everything was working
properly. Finally, I added in the PSU and wired the whole thing up.</p>
<p>Installing the PSU into the Node 304 case was kind of annoying, so for the time
being I left it sitting sideways in the case. If I had to do it all over again,
I would recommend
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/262730-31-breadboarding">breadboarding</a> your
build before putting it in the case. I had issues initially with putting
everything on the motherboard all at once. After plugging everything in I turned
on the power, and nothing happened. Turns out my issue was #6 on this listing
of <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/261145-31-perform-steps-posting-post-boot-video-problems">things to do when your new build has post boot video
problems</a>.</p>
<p>I ended up disconnecting everything from the motherboard, putting in only one
stick of RAM, and plugging in the DVI-D cable into the integrated graphics on
the motherboard. This solved my initial problems. From there I was able to set
an XMP profile, which was able to detect the correct RAM frequency properly in
the BIOS. Then I was able to put in the second stick of RAM. From there I
plugged in the GPU and switched my monitor over to that. At this point the
whole build was still spread over most of my desk.</p>
<p>When I tried to start putting things in their place, I noticed that the
clearance between the PSU and the SATA-III ports were about 5 mm. There was no
way that I was going to get a normal SATA cable to bend in that space. It's
certainly something to think about when putting the Z170N-Gaming5 motherboard
in the Node 304 case. It turns out, what I needed was either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S0X2OI?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00">left-angle SATA
cables</a>
or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0068Q59O2?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00">mini SATA
cables</a>.
I bought two of each, and plugged them all in, even though I only need 3,
because I don't want to have to remove the hard drives and PSU just to plug in
a single SATA cable. For anyone considering a build with this motherboard and
case combination, I recommend the mini SATA cables. They have sufficient bend
in so that you can plug them into the SATA port without too much trouble.</p>
<p>After all was said and done, I dropped Ubuntu 15.10 on it and ran Geekbench. My
Geekbench 3 score came out at slightly over 3800 for single core performance.
Not too bad. I'll take it!</p>
