A while back I was playing around with a combination of [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) and the browser based editor [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/). The results can be seen [here](http://alteregocoding.blogspot.com/). 

It was pretty exciting for a while. The integration of StackEdit with Blogger let me write posts in Markdown and then have it sent up to Blogger for publishing. The problem was that it always seemed a little hacked together. My main problem was that once I published something to Blogger through StackEdit, it became hard to make changes to the post. You'd have to make changes in StackEdit, find the Blogger post ID number, and then re-post to Blogger by giving StackEdit the ID number of the post you want to change. All of that maintenance was not particularly exciting to me, but I made due for a little while.

... then tragedy struck (kind of). I bought my Dell XPS m1330 back in 2006 and it has been by my side ever since. It was the first laptop that Dell sold with Ubuntu pre-installed. The keyboard still rocks compared to the junk you find on laptops these days. The problem is that my near decade old Intel integrated graphics card, Chrome, and WebGL don't seem to get along. Whenever I browse to something using WebGL I get a very depressing Black Screen of Death (KSoD). Is it time for a new laptop? Maybe, but that's a story for another time.

Short story long, StackEdit was doing something that would trigger my KSoD problem, and all of this made me really not feel like jumping through hoops to blog anymore. So I stopped for a while, always on the lookout for something that would be a little simpler than my cobbled together method.

That's when I found GitHub Pages. Now here I am, trying again. I'm excited to see how this turns out.
