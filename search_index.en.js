I think\nit was in 2005. I say that because I remember a buddy of mine wanted me to play\nWorld of Warcraft with him and I needed a new rig to do that. Since then I've\ngradually upgraded some components (RAM, GPU, HDDs), but other than that It's\nthe same build as it was 10+ years ago.\nTime for a refresh. Here's a list of components that I bought for my new rig:\n\nGigabyte Z170N-Gaming5 Motherboard\nIntel i5-6500 LGA 1151 3.2 GHz Skylake CPU\nFractal Design Node 304 Case\nSeasonic G-Series 550 W PSU\n2x Corsair Vengeance LPX 8 GB 2666 MHz DDR4\n\nAnd here are some parts that I scavenged from my old build to cut down on cost:\n\nMSi N630GT-MD1GD3 (NVIDIA GeForce GT630) GPU\n256 GB Samsung 840 EVO SSD\n2x 2 TB WD 7200 RPM HDDs\n\nThe SSD is used for my OS and SWAP partitions, while the two HDDs are set up as\na mirrored ZFS pool and mounted as my /home directory.\nI chose to go with a mini-ITX build because I had never built one before, but I\nuse to live with housemates who had these awesome shoebox sized rigs that fit\non their desktop. They were actually mini-DTX builds, but close enough. Also, I\nthought it was finally time to get rid of my optical drive, and I really wanted\nto have USB3 ports as well.\nIt being so long since I had built a computer from scratch, I did run into some\nissues. The first thing I did was mount my CPU on the motherboard and pop on\nthe stock CPU fan that came with the processor. I then put the stand-offs into\nmy new case and installed the motherboard. Next I installed my GPU, SSD, and\nRAM. I only added the OS drive to check to see that everything was working\nproperly. Finally, I added in the PSU and wired the whole thing up.\nInstalling the PSU into the Node 304 case was kind of annoying, so for the time\nbeing I left it sitting sideways in the case. If I had to do it all over again,\nI would recommend\nbreadboarding your\nbuild before putting it in the case. I had issues initially with putting\neverything on the motherboard all at once. After plugging everything in I turned\non the power, and nothing happened. Turns out my issue was #6 on this listing\nof things to do when your new build has post boot video\nproblems.\nI ended up disconnecting everything from the motherboard, putting in only one\nstick of RAM, and plugging in the DVI-D cable into the integrated graphics on\nthe motherboard. This solved my initial problems. From there I was able to set\nan XMP profile, which was able to detect the correct RAM frequency properly in\nthe BIOS. Then I was able to put in the second stick of RAM. From there I\nplugged in the GPU and switched my monitor over to that. At this point the\nwhole build was still spread over most of my desk.\nWhen I tried to start putting things in their place, I noticed that the\nclearance between the PSU and the SATA-III ports were about 5 mm. There was no\nway that I was going to get a normal SATA cable to bend in that space. It's\ncertainly something to think about when putting the Z170N-Gaming5 motherboard\nin the Node 304 case. It turns out, what I needed was either left-angle SATA\ncables\nor mini SATA\ncables.\nI bought two of each, and plugged them all in, even though I only need 3,\nbecause I don't want to have to remove the hard drives and PSU just to plug in\na single SATA cable. For anyone considering a build with this motherboard and\ncase combination, I recommend the mini SATA cables. They have sufficient bend\nin so that you can plug them into the SATA port without too much trouble.\nAfter all was said and done, I dropped Ubuntu 15.10 on it and ran Geekbench. My\nGeekbench 3 score came out at slightly over 3800 for single core performance.\nNot too bad.

The results can be seen here.\nIt was pretty exciting for a while. The integration of StackEdit with Blogger let me write posts in Markdown and then have it sent up to Blogger for publishing. The problem was that it always seemed a little hacked together. My main problem was that once I published something to Blogger through StackEdit, it became hard to make changes to the post. You'd have to make changes in StackEdit, find the Blogger post ID number, and then re-post to Blogger by giving StackEdit the ID number of the post you want to change.
